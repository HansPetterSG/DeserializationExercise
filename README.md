# Deserializer Exercise
## Building
Once extracted, the application is built by running the following command while inside the *src* folder:

```
javac com/hpsg/*.java
```

The application is created in Java 11 (version "11.0.7").

##Running
The application is then run, from the same location, by running the following command:

```
java com/hpsg/ExerciseClass
```

##Functionality
When running, the application will prompt the user to enter a serialized String representing a data structure. The 
output will consist of a String representation of the data structure formatted in a tree-like structure, followed by a 
String in which the data structure has been serialized by the application. Two different methods are used, and thus 
there are two different sets of outputs, each being marked with which solution produced them.
