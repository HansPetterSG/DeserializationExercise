The primary bottleneck of this application occurs when there are loops and loops within loops, which happens several
times in instances where one substring is iterated on several times: for example, there are instances where the contents
of parentheses are extracted through an iterative process which extracts each character until the parentheses is
closed, after which the isolated content is itself used iteratively. This time consuming element may be reduced with
greater knowledge at first iteration of the nature of the substring being parsed, and theoretically it could be possible
for the application to only need to iterate through the String once, though this seems unlikely to be possible in this
context, especially with significant performance benefits.

The performance may also be somewhat reduced by the increased overhead required in relation to some variables needing to
be Objects instead of more specific types becuase the data structure is described as being capable of containing
several types of data within many of its fields, though this is probably not a significant increase.
